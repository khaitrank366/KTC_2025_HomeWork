                <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of
                    our body as a
                    vehicle that uses food for fuel.
                    Fill your tank with the right type of fuel
                </p>
                <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a
                    permanent change,
                    you will see big results.
                    The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.

                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Limit the consumption of breads, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These food are high in
